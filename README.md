# fast_desmos2

A visualization tool / programming language, based around the syntax of desmos. 

**Note**:
The repo is being migrated to a cargo workspace because it's too complicated. It will be in `fast_desmos2_workspace` on my account once I'm done.

## Goals

The main goal of this project is to improve on the functionality of desmos as a programming language, not as a graphing calculator.

This expands into the following goals:
- Add most of desmos' normal functionality
    - This excludes some useful but irrelevant abilities of desmos: distributions, statistical tests, precise graphing, and more.
- Add more custom functionality
    - Nested lists
    - String manipulation
    - The ability to pipe input in from other applications directly
